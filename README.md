      DESCRIPTION : 
                          As part of the UI/UX Internship with Codtech, I completed Task 1: Redesign a Website Landing Page, where I selected the Zomato homepage for a complete visual and functional overhaul. The goal of this task was to improve both usability and aesthetics while maintaining the brand’s core identity. I chose Zomato because it's a widely recognized food delivery platform, and redesigning its landing page gave me the opportunity to blend creativity with real-world user interface standards.

In my redesign, showcased on the right side of the image, I introduced a fresh and engaging layout. The header now features a vibrant purple geometric banner with the bold “zomato” logo placed prominently to catch the user’s attention instantly. Beside it, I added minimalistic “sign in” and “log in” buttons for better accessibility and visibility. I also included a veg/non-veg toggle switch, which helps users filter content based on dietary preferences—making the homepage more user-personalized and intuitive.

To enhance the user’s browsing experience, I replaced the static tagline with an engaging quote:

"Craving something delicious? Find top-rated food spots around you."
This not only invites users into a flavorful journey but also connects emotionally with them.

The search bar has also been redesigned. Instead of a basic input field, I created a wider, centrally placed field with the prompt:

“Search for the best restaurant or dish u ever found”,
inviting users to recall positive food memories while using the app.

Under the header, I included a new section titled “Taste from India”, featuring illustrated food icons that add personality and visual charm to the page. This section includes popular categories like veg meals, biriyani, pizza, chicken, hotdog, cakes, fries, and a “more” option. The use of clean vector illustrations makes the homepage friendly and inviting, especially for mobile-first users.

One key enhancement is replacing the old “Select from India” dropdown with a more visual approach to food categories. Instead of focusing on city-based selection, my version draws attention directly to food choices—aligning better with what most users care about when they open a food delivery app.

Lastly, I kept the large burger image to maintain Zomato’s original essence, but repositioned it on the bottom right to balance the layout and draw focus back to the call-to-action and search features. I also included a short and catchy quote in place of “select from India” that reads:

“Tasty bites await” — a 15-letter quote designed to feel fresh and inviting.

This redesigned homepage reflects modern design trends, accessibility principles, and emotional engagement. It was created using Figma, and before-and-after comparisons show an improvement in hierarchy, engagement, and user flow. This project not only allowed me to practice UI design skills but also taught me how to blend user-centered design with visual storytelling, making it an invaluable part of my Codtech internship journey.
